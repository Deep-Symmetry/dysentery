= Packet Types
James Elliott <james@deepsymmetry.org>

== Background

The protocol used by Pioneer professional DJ equipment to communicate
and coordinate performances can be monitored to provide useful
information for synchronizing other software, such as light shows and
sequencers. By creating a “virtual CDJ” that sends appropriate packets
to the network, other devices can be induced to send packets
containing even more useful information about their state. This
document details what has been learned so far about the protocol, and
how to accomplish these tasks.

This information was discovered by studying packet captures and with
the help of https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery[dysentery], a
bespoke protocol analysis tool written in Clojure. This document was
created in parallel with the development of dysentery to help spread
the knowledge to other developers using other languages.

Once enough had been understood to start interacting in useful ways
with the devices, the
https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link#beat-link[Beat Link] library
was written to provide a convenient interface for other programs
running in the Java virtual machine. Eventually enough was learned
about the format of the media databases on USB drives and SD cards
inserted in the players to implement
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/crate-digger#crate-digger[Crate
Digger], another Java library which parses them, and whose analysis is
part of this documentation site as well.

Other implementations include
https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/prolink-go[prolink-go] and
https://github.com/flesniak/python-prodj-link[python-prodj-link].

[[packet-types]]
== Known UDP Packet Types

Although there are occasionally TCP connections involved in the
protocol, especially for <<track_metadata.adoc#connecting,track
metadata queries>>, most of the features of the protocol are
implemented through UDP packets sent to a handful of ports, often to
the network broadcast address, but occasionally to individual devices.
These are discussed in more detail in their individual sections, but
here is a breakdown of the packet types which have been discovered so
far.

DJ Link packets seem to all start with a fixed sequence of ten bytes,
`51 73 70 74 31 57 6d 4a 4f 4c`. This is followed by a byte which
(combined with the port on which it was received) identifies what kind
of information is found in the packet.

=== Port 50000 Packets

Packets sent to port 50000 seem primarily related to announcing the
devices present on the network, and negotiating the channel (device)
number assigned to each.

[cols=">1m,<14"]
|===
|Kind |Purpose

|00 |First-stage channel number claim, e.g. <<startup.adoc#mixer-assign-stage-1,mixers>> and <<startup.adoc#cdj-assign-stage-1,CDJs>>.

|01 |<<startup.adoc#assignment-intention-packet,Mixer assignment intention>>, sent by mixers to devices connected to channel-specific ports.

|02 |Second-stage channel number claim, e.g. <<startup.adoc#mixer-assign-stage-2,mixers>> and <<startup.adoc#cdj-assign-stage-2,CDJs>>.

|03 |<<startup.adoc#assignment-packet,Mixer channel assignment>>, sent by mixers to devices connected to channel-specific ports.

|04 |Final-stage channel number claim, e.g. <<startup.adoc#mixer-assign-final,mixers>> and <<startup.adoc#cdj-assign-final,CDJs>>.

|05 |<<startup.adoc#assignment-finished-packet,Mixer assignment finished>>, sent by mixers to devices connected to channel-specific ports.

|06 |Device keep-alive (still present on network), e.g. <<startup.adoc#mixer-keep-alive,mixers>> and <<startup.adoc#cdj-keep-alive,CDJs>>.

|08 |<<startup.adoc#channel-conflict-packet,Channel Conflict>>, sent when a device sees another trying to claim the same channel.

|0a |Initial device announcement, e.g. <<startup.adoc#mixer-initial-announcement,mixers>> and <<startup.adoc#cdj-initial-announcement,CDJs>>.

=== Port 50001 Packets

Packets sent to port 50001 seem primarily related to beat
synchronization (the first element of the protocol that we figured
out), and mixer features like Fader Start and Channels On Air.

|28 |<<beats.adoc#beat-packets,Beat>>
|2a |<<sync.adoc#sync-control,Sync Control>>

=== Port 50002 Packets

Packets sent to port 50002 provide more detailed device status (they
are crucial for figuring out what track a player is playing, at what
tempo, and how much has been played), as well as finding out
information about the media that has been mounted in a particular
slot. They also support remote-control features such as instructing
players to load tracks.

=== Port 50004 Packets

Packets sent to port 50004 provide touch audio data between supported
players and mixers.
